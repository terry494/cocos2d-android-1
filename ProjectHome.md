cocos2d-android on googlecode goes on slow, so I have to create my own to speed it up. This project will port latest cocos2d-iphone code as we have a stable version.

The current follow-up cocos2d-iphone version is 0.99.4

The source code for this probject is on github:
> http://github.com/ZhouWeikuan/cocos2d

The cocos2d tutorial (by Boogle) is available here: http://dan.clarke.name/2011/04/how-to-make-a-simple-android-game-with-cocos2d/
